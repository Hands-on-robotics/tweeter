# Tweeter Project

In essence Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone! Once up and running, just start tweeting!
Since no one like really long posts that go on forever, there is a character counter for the tweets. 
If anyone goes over the character limit or forgets to type a message first, there is a fun and engaging error message for each scenario.

Tweeter is optimized for mobile and desktop use!
!["screenshot of the "]()
!["screenshot of "]()

Error messages oriented towards the UX show the correct use of the app!
